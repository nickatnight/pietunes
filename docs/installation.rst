Installation
============

Lets get the boring stuff out of the way first. This installation assumes you
have a raspberrypi with a fresh OS install. If you need help getting a Debian
image onto a micro or mini usb card, click `here
<https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/>`_.

The 2 main items you will need are:

- Any pi from the RaspberryPi family
- External hard drive to hold audio files

Other 'convenient' items:

- Wifi dongle
- Wireless keyboard/mouse
- HDMI cable
- Usb hub with type b input
- Monitor

.. note:: The convenient items are neccessary for optimal streaming speeds, 
          especially the Usb hub. Since the pi runs on 1000mA, faulty behavior
          will arise if the power isn't distributed evenly amongst the
          peripherals.

Insert the type A male end of the type A-B usb cable into one of the usb ports on the
pi, and the other end (type B male) into the usb hub. Next, insert the
remaining devices into the hub. I won't get into too much detail about the pi's
initial set up (expanding file system, setting up locale, configuring host name,
etc.), but `TechErudio

has some helpful videos to get you up and going with inital set up.

Now onto the juicy stuff...
