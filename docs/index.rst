   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to pieTunes's documentation!
====================================


Everyone loves music right? If you're like me and have been collecting music
since before iPods, your music is most likely spanned across a few mediums
(CDs, Apple devices, Time Machine backups, etc.). Wouldn't it be nice if you
could seamlessly stream all that music from one device? And not shell out
monthly fees for cloud storage? If that sounds like you, then I may have a
solution.

pieTunes is a web application built on Flask, allowing users to stream music on
their local network. Get a hold of an external hard drive and a RaspberryPi (I
prefer 3rd generatoin), and you will be lip signing Marshall Mathers tracks and
humming Avril Lavigne vocals in no time.
